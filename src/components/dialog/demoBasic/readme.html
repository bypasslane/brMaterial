<h4>Dialog</h4>
<p>
  Dialogs can be used to alert the user with a message. They can be used to present a simple message with a 2 button choice. They can also be used to display ritch content allowing you to attach templates, controllers, scope, and locals.
</p>
<p>
  While the alerts will queue, there can only be one dialog on screen at a time.
</p>
<p>
  You can use the `$brDialog` service to controll the dialogs by adding, removing, alerting, locking, and unlocking
